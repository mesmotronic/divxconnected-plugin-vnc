ConnectedVNC
=============

ConnectedVNC is a free, open-source VNC client that allows you to control your Windows PC from your television using your DivX Connected set-top box.

What's it for?
--------------

Because ConnectedVNC allows you use your PC from your TV, you can do things like check your email and browse the web without having to leave the comfort of your arm chair.

Requirements
------------

To use the ConnectedVNC plug-in, you need to install a VNC server on the same PC as the DivX Connected server software; we recommend UltraVNC from http://www.ultravnc.com/.

Once installed, open Admin Properties by right-clicking on the system tray icon, create a password (middle-left), tick the box next to "Allow Loopback Connections" (top-left) and click OK.

That's it! You're ready to use ConnectedVNC.

Audio (optional)
----------------

If you'd like to add audio, you can do so by installing an Icecast or SHOUTcast server alongside DivX Connected to enable you to enjoy applications like Spotify and iTunes remotely.

Getting Started
---------------

To use ConnectedVNC, simply navigate to the Plug-ins menu, or press the orange button on your remote control, and select ConnectedVNC.

On the first screen, highlight the password box and press ENTER on your remote control to bring up the on-screen keyboard, enter your password, then navigate to DONE and press enter. Now, simply press down on your remote control to highlight the Login button and pres ENTER.

If you have entered the correct password, the desktop of your PC should appear.

Remote Control
--------------

ARROWS = Move the mouse up/down/left/right
ENTER = Left mouse click
MENU = Right mouse click
PAGE UP/DOWN = Scroll up/down 
DELETE = Backspace key 
NUMBERS = Number keys 
DOT = Start/end drag

For additional keyboard input, try the Windows on-screen keyboard:

Error Messages
--------------

After you click the Login button, you might see "Connection Error" or "Invalid Password"; a connection error usually occurs because the VNC server is not running, it is being blocked by a firewall or because "Allow Loopback Connections" has not been selected in the VNC server's admin properties.

Either way, press BACK to try again.

Plugin
------

The DivX Connected plugin is stored in the bin-plugin folder and can be installed simply by double clicking on it on any PC with DivX Connected installed.
